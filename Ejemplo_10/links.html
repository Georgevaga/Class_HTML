    <p>Perhaps the most important aspect of HTML is the ability to link from one document to another. This is the basic concept underlying the web and without this functionality the World Wide Web would not exist. </p>
    <h3>Link syntax</h3>
    <p>Creating links is relatively straightforward, and the syntax provides a lot of flexibility in where and how links are applied. To create a links, you&rsquo;ll use the anchor element (&lt;a&gt;) to wrap the content you wish to convert to a link.&nbsp; Attributes inside the anchor tag tell the browser where the page is linking to, or point to an external resource that the browser shoud download.<br>
        Take the following link example:</p>
    <pre>&lt;a href=&rdquo;syntax.htm&rdquo; title=&rdquo;learn more about syntax&rdquo;&gt;HTML syntax&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
    <p>Here the text &ldquo;HTML syntax&rdquo; would now appear as a clickable link. The <b>href</b> attribute tells the browser how to <em>resolve</em> the link; that is where the user should be directed when the link isclicked. The optional <b>title</b> attribute provides a description of the link and is helpful in making the link more accessible.</p>
        <h3>Link types</h3>
    <p>There are three basic types of link: <b>absolute</b>, <b>site-root relative</b>, and <b>document relative</b>. Each of these types refers to the value of the <b>href</b> attribute, which directs how the browser should resolve a link once the link has been clicked. </p>
        <h4>Absolute links </h4>
    <p>These links contain the entire URL necessary to resolve a link, including the protocol. This is usually done for external links, which are links to pages outside of the current site. Here&rsquo;s an esample of an absolute link:</p>
        <pre>&lt;a href=&rdquo;http://www.lynda.com&rdquo; title=&rdquo;You can learn it at lynda.com!&rdquo;&gt;lynda.com&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
        <h4>Document relative links </h4>
    <p>These links are commonly used to navigate internally.</p>
